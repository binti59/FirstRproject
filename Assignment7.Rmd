## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

alpha<-0.05

sample_mean<-mean(adelie_flippers)
sample_sd<-sd(adelie_flippers)
t<-qt(1-alpha/2,df=sample_size-1)
confidence_interval_l<-sample_mean-t*sample_sd/sqrt(sample_size)
confidence_interval_u<-sample_mean+t*sample_sd/sqrt(sample_size)
confidence_interval<-c(confidence_interval_l,confidence_interval_u)
confidence_interval

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
