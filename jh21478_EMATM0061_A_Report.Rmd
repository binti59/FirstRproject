## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
##install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
##install.packages("Stat2Data")
library(Stat2Data)
library(readxl) #load the readxl library
#Locate the folder path to read the file
folder_path<-"/Users/bikramjitchowdhury/Downloads/SCEM/jh21478_EMATM0061_summative_assessment/jh21478_EMATM0061_A/"
#Define the file name
file_name<-"finance_data_EMATM0061.csv" #
#Define the file path
file_path<-paste(folder_path,file_name,sep="") # create the file_path
#Read the file and assign it to a new data frame finance_data_original 

finance_data_original<-read_csv(file_path) 
#Answer A.1
#Rows: 1051 Columns: 30 -There are 1051 rows and 30 columns in this file

#Answer A.2
spec(finance_data_original)

#Create a subset of records called finance_data with 5 rename columns but 1051 rows
finance_data<-finance_data_original%>%select(state_year_code,Details.Education.Education.Total,Details.Health.Health.Total.Expenditure,Details.Transportation.Highways.Highways.Total.Expenditure,Totals.Revenue,Totals.Expenditure)%>%rename(education_expenditure=Details.Education.Education.Total,health_expenditure=Details.Health.Health.Total.Expenditure,transport_expenditure=Details.Transportation.Highways.Highways.Total.Expenditure,totals_revenue=Totals.Revenue,totals_expenditure=Totals.Expenditure) 

#Display the results for the first 5 rows and first 5 columns only
head(finance_data%>%select(state_year_code,education_expenditure,health_expenditure))


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
