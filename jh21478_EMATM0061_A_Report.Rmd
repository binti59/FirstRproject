#Section A
#Locate the folder path to read the file

#Define the file path
file_path<-paste(folder_path,file_name,sep="") # create the file_path
#Read the file and assign it to a new data frame finance_data_original 

finance_data_original<-read_csv(file_path) 
#Answer A.1
#Rows: 1051 Columns: 30 -There are 1051 rows and 30 columns in this file finance_data_EMATM0061.csv
```

```{r}

#Answer A.2
#Calculate the number of columns in the original data frame
ncol(finance_data_original) # 30

#Calculate the number of rows in the original data frame
nrow(finance_data_original)  #1051

#Create a subset of records called finance_data with 5 rename columns but 1051 rows
finance_data<-finance_data_original%>%select(state_year_code,Details.Education.Education.Total,Details.Health.Health.Total.Expenditure,Details.Transportation.Highways.Highways.Total.Expenditure,Totals.Revenue,Totals.Expenditure)%>%rename(education_expenditure=Details.Education.Education.Total,health_expenditure=Details.Health.Health.Total.Expenditure,transport_expenditure=Details.Transportation.Highways.Highways.Total.Expenditure,totals_revenue=Totals.Revenue,totals_expenditure=Totals.Expenditure) 


#Display the results for the first 5 rows and first 5 columns only
head(finance_data%>%select(state_year_code,education_expenditure,health_expenditure),5)
```

```{r}

#Answer A.3
#Add the new column  total_savings in the finance data dataframe
finance_data<-finance_data%>%mutate(totals_savings=(totals_revenue-totals_expenditure))

#Display the first 3 rows and the four columns “state_year_code”,“totals_revenue”,“totals_expenditure”,“totals_savings” of the data frame finance_data
head(finance_data%>%select(state_year_code,totals_revenue,totals_expenditure,totals_savings),3)

```

```{r}

#A.4


#Separate the state_year_code coloumn into two seperate columns
finance_data<-finance_data%>%separate(state_year_code,into=c("state","year"),sep="__")

#Convert the states so that they appear with the first letter of each word in upper case and the remainder in lower case

finance_data$state=str_to_title(finance_data$state)

#Display the first 3 rows and the four columns
head(finance_data%>%select(state,year,totals_revenue,totals_expenditure,totals_savings),3)

#A.5
#Generate a plot which displays the total revenue (“total_revenue”) as function of the year (“year”) for the following
#four states: Louisiana, Montana, Mississippi and Kentucky.
#Display the revenue in terms of millions of dollars

finance_data%>%rename(State=state)%>%filter(State %in% c("Louisiana","Montana","Mississippi","Kentucky"))%>%ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(year),y=totals_revenue/1000000),color=State)+xlab("Year")+theme_bw()+ylab("Revenue(in millions)")+geom_smooth(aes(color=State,linetype=State),size=1)

#A.6

#Create a function called get_decade() which takes as input a number and rounds that number down to the
#nearest multiple of 10. 

get_decade<-function(x){
 
  y=floor((x/10))*10  ;
  return(y);
}

get_decade(243)

#Use  get_decade() function to add a new column to the “finance_data” data frame called “decade” which should give the decade corresponding to the year column.

finance_data<-finance_data%>%mutate(decade=get_decade(as.numeric(year)))

#Three states had the highest mean-average savings (“totals_savings”) over the decade starting 2000

finance_data%>%filter(decade==2000)%>%group_by(state)%>%summarise(mean_total_savings=mean(totals_savings,na.rm=TRUE))%>%arrange(desc(mean_total_savings))%>%head(3)

#The three states with the highest mean total savings are Texas, Ohio and California.

# Create the Alaska summary data frame with the following properties
#(a) “decade” – the decade (1990, 2000, 2010)
#(b) “ed_mn” – the mean of the education expenditure in Alaska for the corresponding decade
#(c) “ed_md” – the median of the education expenditure in Alaska for the corresponding decade
#(d) “he_mn” – the mean of the health expenditure in Alaska for the corresponding decade
#(e) “he_md” – the median of the health expenditure in Alaska for the corresponding decade
#(f) “tr_mn” – the mean of the transport expenditure in Alaska for the corresponding decade
#(g) “tr_md” – the median of the transport expenditure in Alaska for the corresponding decade.

alaska_summary<-finance_data%>%filter(state=='Alaska')%>%group_by(decade)%>%select(decade,education_expenditure,health_expenditure,transport_expenditure)%>%summarise(across(starts_with(c("education_expenditure","health_expenditure","transport_expenditure")),list(md=median,mn=mean),.names="{substring(.col,1,2)}_{.fn}"))

#Display the Alaska summary data frame
alaska_summary

#A.8 Create a function called impute_by_median which takes as input a vector numerical values, which may include some “NA”s, and replaces any missing values (“NA”s) with the median over the vector.

impute_by_median<-function(x){
med <-median(x,na.rm=1)   # first calculate the median of x
impute_f<-function(z){  # coordinate wise imputation
if(is.na(z)){
return(med)
}  #if z is na replace with mean
else{
return(z)#otherwise leave in place
} 
}
return(map_dbl(x,impute_f)) #apply the map function to impute across vector
}

#generate a subset of your “finance_data” data frame called “idaho_2000” which contains all those rows in which the state column takes the value “Idaho” and the “decade” column takes the value “2000” and includes the columns “year”, “education_expenditure”, “health_expenditure”, “transport_expenditure”, “totals_revenue”,“totals_expenditure”, “totals_savings” (i.e. all columns except “state” and “decade”).


idaho_2000<-finance_data%>%filter(state=='Idaho' & decade==2000)%>%select(-state,-decade)

#Now apply your “impute_by_median” data frame to create a new data frame called “idaho_2000_imputed” which is based on your existing “idaho_2000” data frame but with any missing values replaced with the corresponding median value for the that column. 

idaho_2000_imputed<-idaho_2000%>%select(year,health_expenditure,education_expenditure,totals_savings)%>%summarise(year,across(where(is.numeric),~impute_by_median(.x)))

#Display the imputed values
idaho_2000_imputed
