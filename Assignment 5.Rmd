## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(0)
n<-1000
sample_X<-data.frame(U=runif(n))%>%
mutate(X=case_when(
(0<=U)&(U<0.25)~1,
(0.25<=U)&(U<0.5)~5,
(0.5<=U)&(U<=1)~0))%>%
pull(X)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
